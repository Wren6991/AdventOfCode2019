Advent of Code 2019
===================

Each numbered directory contains my solutions to one day of Advent of Code problems. I was a bit late to the game, and did not start these problems until the 13th of December.

Day 01
------

I used Python 3 here. Both solutions are one-liners, albeit one line is much longer, and redditors will hate it due to lack of tail recursion.

[Part 2 (Python)](01/part2.py)

Day 02
------

I wrote an extremely quick-and-dirty IntcodeV1 simulator in Python 3, to run the program. This solved the first problem. The second (a search for two integer inputs to the program which would produce a given output) was solved by hand.
